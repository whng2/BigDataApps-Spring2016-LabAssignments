2.	Watch Application
Data collection related to your own project through Smart Phone and Watch, send notifications to watch using intuitive data analysis.


Brief Description about your implementation :
Run R package, calculate k-Means, k-Medians, Expectation Maximisation (EM), Hierarchical Clustering.

Developed android app sent notifications from app to watch and showing reading numbers such as magnetic numbers.


For example: What dataset used? What REST API's used? What Alogrithm was used? etc.
