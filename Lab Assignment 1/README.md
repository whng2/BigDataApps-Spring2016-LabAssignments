Lab Assignment 1 :

Question:

Brief Description about your implementation :


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1)	Write a map-reduce pseudo code for Sum of Two Matrices. 
2)	Create GitHub Account. Create a repository in remote Github. Clone it to local machine.
Create 2 (Source and Documentation) directories in local github.
Put the document with the pseudo code of question (1) under documentation directory in the local windows Github and sync it to remote Github.
3)	Create ZenHub Tool Account. Create a board, 3 iterations, at least 5 tasks and show the analytics graph.



For example: What dataset used? What REST API's used? What Alogrithm was used? etc.

Mapper, Reducer techniques need to be used to solve the sun of two matrices problem.
